## App Description

I have developed a React Native App that is a money converter. I used the https://openexchangerates.org/ (Version Free) to make the exchange.

It has this functionalities:

    • An input to enter the amount
    • A  label with the output
    • A money selector for the input
    • A money selector for the output
	
It looks similar to these mockups: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VugklIjyoSqfZTyjiZNjqula1CMvP9Mx/view?usp=sharing

Bonus: I have added the reverse currencies button that helps the user with the money convertion between 2 inputs.

## Common issues

Perhaps the node version in your laptop is not compatible with the app. In that case, you shold download NVM. 
It is the easiest way to install and use a new version of node.
